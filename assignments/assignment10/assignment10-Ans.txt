1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
--> While shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it.

2. What function is used to rename files??
--> os.rename()

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
-->The send2trash functions will move a file or folder to the recycle bin, 
while shutil functions will permanently delete files and folders.

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
--> .extract() to etract and .read to read.

5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
--> 
import os, shutil
for basename in os.listdir(srcdir):
    if basename.endswith('.pdf'):
        pathname = os.path.join(srcdir, basename)
        if os.path.isfile(pathname):
            shutil.copy2(pathname, dstdir)
