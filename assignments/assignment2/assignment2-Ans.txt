1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True, False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
and, or and not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables 
(i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
AND operator 
First  Second  Result
True	True	True
True	False	False
False	True	False
False	False	False

OR operator
First  Second  Result
True	True	True
True	False	True
False	True	True
False	False	False

NOT operator
Operand Result
True    False
False   True
 

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                --> False
not (5 > 4)                         --> Fasle
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                 --> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))           --> False
(True and True) and (True == False) --> False
(not False) or (not True)           --> True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
equal to (==), 
not equal to (!=), 
greater than (>), 
greater than or equal to(>=), 
less than (<),
less than or equal to(<=)

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe
 a condition and when you would use one.
equal is like == (condition) and assignment is like = 
ex: assignment  egg = 100
    equal       (3 == 5)

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0        
if spam == 10:  --> Block 1
    print('eggs')
if spam > 5:    --> Block 2
    print('bacon')
else:           --> Block 3
    print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, 
prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam = 1      
if spam == 1:  
    print('hello')
elif spam == 2:    
    print('Howdy')
else:           
    print('Greetings!')


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
CTRL + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Break - It eliminates the execution of remaining iteration of loop. It stops the continuation of the loop.
Continue - It will terminate only the current iteration of loop.It does not stop the continuation of loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
range(10) starts with 0 by default and ends at 9 (10 elements)
range(0, 10) starts at 0 and end at 10th element (same outcome)
range*(0, 10, 1) starts at 0 end's at 10th position and step of 1 

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

i = 1
while i < 11:
  print(i)
  i += 1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
import spam

spam.bacon()
